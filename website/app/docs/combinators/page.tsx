      <blockquote>
        <strong>Think of it like…</strong> assembling a security checkpoint.{" "}
        <code>every()</code> chains the metal detector, the bag scan, and the ID
        check in order. <code>some()</code> says &quot;any valid ID gets you in
        — passport OR driver&apos;s license OR staff badge.&quot;{" "}
        <code>except()</code> waves the staff entrance through without the
        queue.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        DaloyJS exposes three small composition primitives for{" "}
        <code>Hooks</code> bundles. They let you package curated middleware
        stacks as a single value, express &quot;any of these proofs is
        enough&quot; authentication, and exempt specific paths from a check —
        all without any runtime dependencies.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <code>every()</code> — run a whole stack in order
      </h2>
      <p>
        <code>every(...layers)</code> merges several <code>Hooks</code> bundles
        into one that runs each layer in registration order. It is equivalent to
        calling <code>app.use(...)</code> for each bundle, but lets you name and
        reuse a curated stack. All lifecycle phases compose, and symbol-keyed
        security markers (CORS / CSRF / session / secure-headers) are forwarded
        so boot-time guards still see them.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock

// Package "the admin stack" as a single reusable value.
const adminStack = every(
  requestId(),
  bearerAuth({ validate: (token) => token === process.env.ADMIN_TOKEN }),

      <h2>
        <code>some()</code> — accept any one proof of identity

      <p>
        <code>some(...layers)</code> runs each bundle&apos;s{" "}
        <code>beforeHandle</code> in order and accepts the request as soon as
        one of them passes without throwing. Use it for &quot;this route accepts
        a bearer token OR a signed session cookie OR an API key&quot; patterns.

        code={`import { App, some, bearerAuth, session } from "@daloyjs/core";

      <p>Semantics worth knowing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first bundle that resolves without throwing wins; its context
          mutations (headers, <code>ctx.state</code>) are preserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          A bundle that returns a <code>Response</code> is treated as a denial,
          and the next bundle gets a chance. If every bundle denies, the first
          denial wins.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the first denial is a thrown error, that error is rethrown — so
          place the auth method whose <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> challenge
          you want clients to see first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only the <code>beforeHandle</code> evaluation strategy changes; all
          other phases still compose normally.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <code>except()</code> — apply everywhere but a few paths
      </h2>
      <p>
        <code>except(when, hooks)</code> runs a bundle on every request{" "}
        <em>except</em> those matching <code>when</code>. The canonical use is
        &quot;apply auth everywhere except the public endpoints.&quot;
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`import { App, except, bearerAuth } from "@daloyjs/core";

const app = new App();

app.use(except(
  ["/health", "/openapi.json", "/docs/**"],
  bearerAuth({ validate: (token) => token === process.env.API_TOKEN }),
));`}
      />
      <p>
        The <code>when</code> matcher accepts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A path string starting with <code>/</code>. <code>*</code> matches one
          path segment (no slash); <code>**</code> matches any suffix (zero or
          more segments).
        </li>
        <li>An array of such path patterns.</li>
        <li>
          A predicate function that receives the request context and returns{" "}
          <code>true</code> to skip the gated bundle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only the <code>beforeHandle</code> phase is gated. The surrounding{" "}
        <code>onRequest</code>/<code>afterHandle</code>/<code>onSend</code>/
        <code>onResponse</code> phases still run, so shared concerns like
        request-id propagation are never accidentally exempted.
