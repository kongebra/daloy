          <p>
            I have been writing backends for about ten years now. I started in
            Manila, I now live in Norway, and somewhere along that journey I
            learned a hard truth: most production incidents are not caused by
            clever attackers. They are caused by us shipping code that we never
            really read. In 2027 that problem has a name, and the name is vibe
            coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me explain what I mean, because &quot;vibe coding&quot; gets
            thrown around as a joke and it is not a joke anymore.
          </p>

          <h2>The state of the world in 2027</h2>
          <p>
            Most backend code today is written by an AI. I am not being
            dramatic. Non-developers describe an app in plain English, the model
            produces something that runs, and it gets deployed within the hour.
            Engineers are doing the same thing, just with more confidence and
            slightly better commit messages. We let agents install dependencies,
            run the tests, and open the pull request. The code works on the
            happy path, the demo looks great, everyone claps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then it goes to production with no body limits, input validation
            that is &quot;optional&quot; because it slowed down the demo, an
            admin route that somebody forgot to unmount, and an outbound{" "}
            <code>fetch</code> that will cheerfully call{" "}
            <code>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/</code> if you ask it
            nicely. The app is one crafted request away from leaking its own
            cloud credentials, and nobody on the team can tell you that, because
            nobody on the team wrote that line.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to be fair here. The AI is not the villain. The AI did
            exactly what we asked. We asked it to &quot;make it work,&quot; and
            there is a famous line from the Supabase and Aikido write-up on
            secure-by-default development that I keep pinned to my monitor:{" "}
            <em>
              &quot;If you tell an AI to make something work, it might remove the
              very security checks that protect you.&quot;
            </em>{" "}
            That is the whole problem in one sentence. The model optimizes for
            the request, and &quot;make it work&quot; almost never includes
            &quot;and also do not let strangers read my database.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, the dependency tree itself became the attack
            surface. In the last couple of years we have watched
            self-replicating npm worms, malicious <code>postinstall</code>{" "}
            scripts, CI cache poisoning, and a newer favorite called
            slopsquatting, where an attacker pre-registers a package name that
            an AI assistant is statistically likely to hallucinate. Your agent
            confidently runs <code>pnpm add @types/fastify-helmet</code>, the
            package exists because somebody was waiting for exactly that
            hallucination, and now you have a wallet drainer in your lockfile.
            Fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that is the environment. Fast code, written by machines, deployed
            by people who trust the machine, on top of a registry that has
            become a minefield. This is the world DaloyJS was built for. Not the
            world of five years ago. This one.
          </p>

          <h2>What DaloyJS actually is</h2>
          <p>
            DaloyJS (<code>@daloyjs/core</code>) is a runtime-portable,
            contract-first TypeScript web framework. That is a mouthful, so here
            is the plain version. You define a route once. That single
            definition is the source of truth for validation, your TypeScript
            types, your OpenAPI 3.1 document, your typed client, and your
            contract tests. No decorators, no separate schema files that drift
            out of sync, no &quot;the docs say one thing and the code does
            another&quot; energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it runs the same code on Node, Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers,
            Vercel (Node and Edge), Fastly Compute, and AWS Lambda. The core
            only ever sees a web-standard <code>Request</code> and returns a{" "}
            <code>Response</code>. The runtime-specific stuff lives in thin
            adapters at the edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the part I actually care about, the part that made me stop using
            other frameworks for new projects, is the design stance. DaloyJS
            attacks the vibe-coding problem from two directions at the same
            time.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>A secure-by-default runtime.</strong> The dangerous things
              are off until you turn them on. The safe things are on until you
              turn them off. The framework will literally refuse to boot on
              certain unsafe configurations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A hardened supply chain.</strong> Zero runtime
              dependencies, npm provenance, SBOMs, and a pnpm posture that
              assumes the registry is hostile, because it is.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The trick, and the reason I am writing a whole blog post about it
            instead of one tweet, is that none of this costs you developer
            experience. The secure path is also the path of least resistance.
            You do not earn security by suffering. You get it by default and
            then you have to go out of your way to remove it. That is the
            inversion that matters.
          </p>
          <p>Let me show you, because I trust code more than I trust adjectives.</p>

          <h2>Hello world, and notice what you did not have to do</h2>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={HELLO_WORLD} />
          <p>
            That is a complete API. Here is what you got for free without typing
            a single extra line: a hard body-size cap so a 4GB upload cannot eat
            your memory, a request timeout so a slow-loris client cannot hold
            your handlers hostage, a JSON parser that strips{" "}
            <code>__proto__</code> and <code>constructor</code> so prototype
            pollution does not happen, a router that rejects <code>..</code>{" "}
            path segments before it walks anything, header sanitizers that
            reject CRLF and NUL so nobody can smuggle a response split through
            your logs, and RFC 9457 problem+json errors that redact their{" "}
            <code>detail</code> field in production so your 500 does not hand a
            stranger a stack trace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The validator is Zod 4 here, but DaloyJS speaks Standard Schema, so
            Valibot, ArkType, and TypeBox all work too. No lock-in. If your team
            already has opinions about schema libraries, bring them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now compare that to a typical vibe-coded Express app. The model
            gives you <code>{`app.get('/books/:id', ...)`}</code>, it works, it
            ships. There is no body limit. There is no timeout. The JSON parser
            will happily accept{" "}
            <code>{`{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}`}</code>. The error handler
            prints the stack trace because that was helpful during development
            and nobody removed it. None of that is malicious. It is just
            absence. DaloyJS is built on the idea that absence is the bug.
          </p>

          <h2>The framework that refuses to start</h2>
          <p>
            This is my favorite feature and it sounds aggressive when you first
            hear it. DaloyJS will refuse to boot if you configure it in a way
            that is known to be dangerous. It does not warn. It does not log
            politely and continue. It throws and your process does not come up.
          </p>
          <p>Things that will stop your app from starting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>{`cors({ origin: "*" })`}</code> with{" "}
              <code>credentials: true</code>. This is the classic &quot;I just
              wanted the CORS error to go away&quot; move, and it is also how you
              let any website on the internet make authenticated requests as your
              logged-in user. DaloyJS throws at construction.
            </li>
            <li>
              A weak session secret. If your secret is shorter than 32 bytes or
              is one of the known weak strings (think <code>{`"secret"`}</code>,{" "}
              <code>{`"changeme"`}</code>), it will not boot.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <code>session()</code> plus a state-changing route with no{" "}
              <code>csrf()</code> protection. The framework notices you have
              cookies and a POST route and no CSRF, and it stops you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unconfigured <code>X-Forwarded-*</code> handling in production. If
              you are behind a proxy and you have not told the framework whom to
              trust, it will not silently believe spoofed client IPs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={REFUSE_BOOT} />
          <p>
            I know some of you just twitched. &quot;What if I have a legitimate
            reason?&quot; Then you fix the default for everyone with a scoped
            knob, you do not strip the guardrail inline. The framework&apos;s
            philosophy, which is written into its contributor rules in capital
            letters, is that bad defaults are bugs. If a guard genuinely blocks a
            real use case, the answer is a narrower override, not a deleted
            check. For service-to-service deployments behind a mesh there is even
            a <code>{`preset: "internal-service"`}</code> that turns off the
            browser-only guards (the CORS guard, the CSRF boot guard, auto secure
            headers) while keeping every input, parser, credential, and SSRF
            guard on. The choice gets logged at boot, and you can audit the live
            posture with <code>app.getSecurityPosture()</code>. Opt-in, visible,
            reversible. That is the pattern.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters specifically for vibe coding because the failure mode of
            an AI is not malice, it is plausibility. The model writes config that
            looks correct. A refuse-to-boot guard converts &quot;looks
            correct&quot; into &quot;actually correct or the process dies,&quot;
            and a dead process in CI is a million times cheaper than a live
            process in production.
          </p>

          <h2>SSRF, or the call your handler should never make</h2>
          <p>
            Here is the one that keeps cloud engineers up at night. Your app
            takes a URL from a user, maybe for a webhook, an image import, a link
            preview. The handler does <code>await fetch(url)</code>. An attacker
            passes{" "}
            <code>
              http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
            </code>
            , your server fetches it, and now the response body contains your
            instance&apos;s IAM credentials. This is Server-Side Request Forgery
            and it is responsible for some of the biggest cloud breaches we have
            on record.
          </p>
          <p>
            DaloyJS ships <code>fetchGuard()</code>, which is a drop-in
            replacement for <code>fetch</code> with a hard-deny floor.
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={FETCH_GUARD} />
          <p>
            The deny list is not advisory. It covers every documented cloud
            metadata IP: the AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, and GCP IMDS address{" "}
            <code>169.254.169.254</code>, the AWS ECS task metadata and EKS Pod
            Identity ranges, the Oracle <code>192.0.0.192</code>, the Alibaba{" "}
            <code>100.100.100.200</code>, link-local, loopback, and private
            ranges. And here is the detail I really like: it re-resolves on
            redirects, so an attacker cannot hand you a friendly{" "}
            <code>https://example.com</code> that quietly <code>302</code>s to{" "}
            <code>http://169.254.169.254</code>. The hard-deny floor cannot be
            lifted by any allow flag. Even if you misconfigure your allow list,
            you cannot accidentally re-expose the metadata endpoint. That is what
            &quot;secure by default&quot; means in practice: the safe thing is
            not something you remembered to do, it is something you would have to
            fight the framework to undo.
          </p>

          <h2>Tokens, because everybody gets JWT wrong</h2>
          <p>
            JWT is a minefield and most tutorials walk you straight into it. The{" "}
            <code>{`alg: "none"`}</code> attack, algorithm confusion where an
            attacker swaps RS256 for HS256 and signs with your public key, tokens
            with no expiry that live forever. DaloyJS bakes the lessons in.
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={JWT_JWK} />
          <p>
            The signer and verifier refuse <code>{`alg: "none"`}</code>. They
            accept only an explicit algorithm allowlist, never &quot;whatever the
            token claims.&quot; They refuse to mix HS secrets with JWK key
            material, which is the algorithm-confusion defense. They refuse to
            sign a token without an <code>exp</code>. And they refuse HS-shaped
            secrets under 32 bytes per RFC 7518. The <code>jwk()</code>{" "}
            middleware is asymmetric-only on purpose, requires{" "}
            <code>https://</code> JWKS URLs, caches them with in-flight promise
            dedup, and cross-checks the <code>kid</code> and the JWT-versus-JWK
            algorithm. You do not have to know any of this to be protected by it,
            which is the point. The default is the secure one.
          </p>
          <p>
            DaloyJS is a resource server, by the way, not an identity provider.
            It verifies and enforces tokens. It does not run a login page. Bring
            Keycloak, Zitadel, Auth0, Entra ID, Cognito, whatever you like. Do
            not build your own authorization server. I have seen people try. It
            does not end well.
          </p>

          <h2>Now the developer experience, which is why you will actually use it</h2>
          <p>
            I have made the security pitch. But here is the thing about security
            tools: if they are miserable to use, people route around them, and a
            guardrail you disabled is worse than no guardrail because it gives you
            false confidence. So the DX has to be genuinely good, not &quot;good
            for a security framework.&quot; Let me show you the part that made me
            a believer.
          </p>
          <p>One route definition gives you a typed client with zero codegen. Look:</p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={TYPED_CLIENT} />
          <p>
            That <code>getBookById</code> method, its input shape, and its
            per-status response union are all inferred from the route definition.
            If you change the route, the client type changes, and your consuming
            code stops compiling until you fix it. No generation step, no stale
            client, no &quot;the mobile team is still on the old contract&quot;
            meeting. For consumers that cannot import your TypeScript (a different
            repo, a different language), one <code>pnpm gen</code> command runs
            your live OpenAPI spec through Hey API and emits a fully typed fetch
            SDK.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the docs. This is the FastAPI feature everyone wishes Node had,
            and it is one line:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={DOCS_ONE_LINER} />
          <p>
            That mounts an interactive Scalar UI at <code>/docs</code>, plus the
            JSON and YAML specs, with a strict CSP. Switch to Swagger UI or Redoc
            with one word (<code>{`ui: "swagger"`}</code>). The docs are always
            contract-accurate because they are generated from the same route
            definitions that run your server. They cannot go stale. If you omit
            the <code>info</code> block, DaloyJS reads your{" "}
            <code>package.json</code> for the title and version. Less
            boilerplate, fewer things to forget.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a fuller route, the kind I actually write, with auth,
            validation, and typed error responses:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={FULLER_ROUTE} />
          <p>
            The <code>bearerAuth</code> comparison uses a timing-safe equal under
            the hood, so you do not leak token bytes through response timing. The
            body is validated against the schema before your handler runs, and if
            it fails, the client gets a clean 422 problem+json, not a 500 with a
            stack trace. You declared <code>422</code> in the contract, so it is
            in your OpenAPI doc and your typed client too. One source of truth,
            the whole way down.
          </p>

          <h2>The supply chain, because your dependencies are also your attack surface</h2>
          <p>
            You can write the most careful handler in the world and still get
            owned through a <code>postinstall</code> script in a transitive
            dependency you never chose. So the second front matters as much as
            the first.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>@daloyjs/core</code> has zero runtime dependencies. Not
            &quot;few.&quot; Zero. That is enforced in CI by a gate called{" "}
            <code>verify:no-runtime-deps</code>, and it is treated as a floor,
            not a goal. A hallucinated dependency literally cannot transitively
            land in the published tarball, because there is no dependency tree to
            hide in. Every feature I described in this article, the JWT verifier,
            the SSRF guard, the WAF, the rate limiter, the WebSocket layer, is
            built on web-standard APIs and Node built-ins. No{" "}
            <code>node_modules</code> surprise party.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scaffolder ships a hardened <code>.npmrc</code>:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ini" code={HARDENED_NPMRC} />
          <p>
            <code>ignore-scripts=true</code> kills lifecycle-script payloads,
            which is how most install-time worms detonate.{" "}
            <code>minimum-release-age=1440</code> refuses to install anything
            published in the last 24 hours, which is the typical window in which
            a malicious package gets detected and unpublished. Combined, those
            two defaults blunt slopsquatting hard. The attacker pre-registers the
            name your agent will hallucinate, but your install refuses fresh
            packages and refuses lifecycle scripts, and a workspace gate called{" "}
            <code>verify:known-dep-names</code> refuses any top-level dependency
            name that is not on an explicit allowlist. So{" "}
            <code>pnpm add some-hallucinated-name</code> cannot quietly land in a{" "}
            <code>package.json</code>. It forces a one-line diff that a human has
            to look at. That review checkpoint is the whole defense, and the
            framework makes it unavoidable.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, <code>@daloyjs/core</code> is published with npm
            provenance and ships CycloneDX 1.5 plus SPDX 2.3 SBOMs, regenerated
            and verified on every release. There is a whole pile of CI gates with
            names like <code>verify:no-registry-exfiltration</code>,{" "}
            <code>verify:no-remote-exec</code>,{" "}
            <code>verify:no-lifecycle-scripts</code>, and{" "}
            <code>verify:no-weak-random</code>, and they carry IOC coverage for
            active campaigns. There are even gates that scan AI-agent config files
            (<code>CLAUDE.md</code>, <code>.cursorrules</code>,{" "}
            <code>AGENTS.md</code>) for the prompt-injection persistence trick the
            TrapDoor crypto-stealer used, and gates that refuse editor configs
            that auto-run a command on folder open, which is how the Miasma worm
            detonated. The supply chain is treated as hostile, which in 2027 is
            just accurate.
          </p>

          <h2>Defense in depth, when the edge WAF is somebody else&apos;s budget line</h2>
          <p>
            Not every team has a CDN WAF in front of their app. DaloyJS gives you
            first-party, opt-in layers so the framework itself can do some of that
            work:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>waf()</code> runs a scored inbound inspection pass for SQLi,
              XSS, NoSQL operator injection, and command injection. It is defense
              in depth, not a ModSecurity replacement, and it has a{" "}
              <code>log</code> mode so you can tune against real traffic before you
              start blocking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>autoBan()</code> is fail2ban for your app: repeat offenders
              who keep hitting 401/403/429 get temporarily banned, with
              exponential escalation and decay.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>botGuard()</code> verifies declared crawlers with reverse-DNS
              plus forward-confirm, so a request claiming to be Googlebot has to
              actually be Googlebot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>geoBlock()</code>, <code>ipReputation()</code>,{" "}
              <code>concurrencyLimit()</code>, and{" "}
              <code>requestDecompression()</code> (a zip-bomb guard that aborts
              during inflation) round it out.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={DEFENSE} />
          <p>
            And on WebSockets, the framework closes the Cross-Site WebSocket
            Hijacking class of bug by refusing to register a production WS route
            unless you provide an Origin policy or explicitly acknowledge a
            cross-origin upgrade. Cookie auth alone does not stop a malicious site
            from opening an authenticated handshake from your user&apos;s browser,
            which is exactly the Storybook CVE-2026-27148 pattern. The Origin
            check runs before your upgrade hook, on both Node and Bun. Again: the
            safe thing is the default, and you have to go out of your way to
            remove it.
          </p>

          <h2>Same code, every runtime</h2>
          <p>
            Because the core is just <code>Request</code> to{" "}
            <code>Response</code>, deployment is a one-line import swap. No
            rewrite when your platform decision changes, and platform decisions
            always change.
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={RUNTIMES} />
          <p>
            The routing is fast too, if you care about that sort of thing (I do).
            Static routes resolve through a single <code>Map.get</code> at
            roughly 12 million ops per second, dynamic routes walk a trie in time
            proportional to the number of path segments, body parsing is lazy and
            only runs when a route declares a body schema, and there is no regex
            on the hot path. The secure defaults do not cost you throughput.
          </p>

          <h2>So is this the Express alternative? Yes, and here is the honest version</h2>
          <p>
            The title of this post ends with a question mark on purpose.
            &quot;Alternative to Express&quot; is a big claim, and Express is not
            bad software. It powered half the internet for a decade, it is in my
            muscle memory, and I have shipped a lot of money-making code on top of
            it. I am not here to dunk on it. I am here to argue that the thing
            that made Express great in 2015, that it does almost nothing and gets
            out of your way, is exactly the thing that makes it dangerous in the
            vibe-coding era of 2027.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think about what an Express app actually is. In its own documentation
            it is described as &quot;essentially a series of middleware function
            calls.&quot; You wire up <code>(req, res, next)</code> callbacks, you
            mutate <code>res</code>, and you call <code>res.send()</code> to end
            the cycle. That is a beautiful, minimal model. It is also a blank
            canvas, and a blank canvas is the worst possible thing to hand an AI
            that was told to &quot;make it work.&quot; The model will not add{" "}
            <code>helmet</code>. It will not add a body limit. It will not add a
            rate limiter or a request timeout. It will not validate{" "}
            <code>req.body</code>, which is typed <code>any</code>, so TypeScript
            will not save you either. Every one of those is something a human has
            to remember to bolt on, and the entire premise of vibe coding is that
            nobody is remembering anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here is the concrete case for DaloyJS as the Express alternative,
            point by point, and none of these are things I made up for a blog
            post. They are the actual reasons written into our migration guide:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>OpenAPI and a typed client for free.</strong> In Express
              you bolt on <code>swagger-jsdoc</code>, hand-write JSDoc comments
              above each route, and pray they stay in sync with the code. They
              never do. In DaloyJS the route definition <em>is</em> the spec, so
              it cannot drift, and a typed SDK falls out of <code>pnpm gen</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Validation the type system actually trusts.</strong> Express
              hands you <code>req.body as any</code> and wishes you luck. DaloyJS
              validates with Standard Schema (Zod, Valibot, ArkType) and infers
              your handler&apos;s <code>params</code>, <code>query</code>, and{" "}
              <code>body</code> types from the same schemas that do the runtime
              checking. One source of truth, no casts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secure defaults instead of a TODO list.</strong> This is the
              whole thesis of the article. Express ships almost nothing on the
              security front. DaloyJS ships body limits, request timeouts, header
              sanitization, prototype-pollution-safe JSON, and one-line{" "}
              <code>secureHeaders()</code> and <code>rateLimit()</code> helpers,
              and it refuses to boot on configurations that are known to be
              unsafe.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Run the same app everywhere.</strong> Express is welded to
              Node&apos;s <code>http</code> module. DaloyJS is built on
              web-standard <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code>, so the
              same app object runs on Node, Bun, Deno, Workers, Vercel, and
              Lambda. When your platform decision changes (it will), you swap an
              import, not a framework.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zero runtime dependencies.</strong> A fresh Express app
              pulls in dozens of transitive packages, and every one of them is a
              slopsquatting target and a <code>postinstall</code> risk.{" "}
              <code>@daloyjs/core</code> has none. There is no dependency tree for
              a malicious package to hide in.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Now, I am going to be honest about when you should <em>not</em> do
            this, because a blog post that only tells you to migrate is a sales
            brochure, not advice. If your app is mostly server-rendered HTML
            through a view engine like EJS or Pug, DaloyJS is API-first and will
            fight you. If you depend on one weird Express middleware with no
            equivalent and no appetite to port it, check that first. And if the
            app is in stable maintenance-only mode, migration has a cost and you
            should spend that energy somewhere with upside. Greenfield services,
            anything where you were about to add OpenAPI anyway, and apps that
            keep getting bitten by untyped <code>req.body</code> bugs are the
            sweet spot.
          </p>

          <h2>We actually wrote the migration guide, so you do not have to guess</h2>
          <p>
            Here is the part I am genuinely proud of. A lot of frameworks tell you
            they are &quot;a great Express alternative&quot; and then leave you to
            figure out the move on your own. We wrote the whole thing down. There
            is a complete, no-prior-knowledge{" "}
            <Link href="/docs/migrating/express">
              Migrate from Express.js to DaloyJS
            </Link>{" "}
            guide in the docs that maps every Express concept you already know to
            its DaloyJS equivalent, with before-and-after code for each one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core mental shift is one sentence: you stop mutating{" "}
            <code>res</code> and calling <code>next()</code>, and you start
            declaring a contract and returning a value. Here is the side-by-side
            that the guide opens with:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="text" code={MENTAL_MODEL} />
          <p>
            The thing I want you to notice is how much code <em>disappears</em> in
            the translation. Take a typical Express route with manual validation
            and manual error handling:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={EXPRESS_ROUTE} />
          <p>
            The DaloyJS version of that route deletes the body-parser line, the
            manual <code>if (!id || !title)</code> check, the hand-rolled auth
            status, and the catch-all error middleware, and gives you an OpenAPI
            entry and a typed client in exchange:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={DALOY_ROUTE} />
          <p>
            You throw a <code>NotFoundError</code> instead of building one by
            hand. You declare the <code>422</code> and DaloyJS returns it for you
            when validation fails, so your handler only ever runs on valid input.
            Your <code>helmet</code> becomes <code>secureHeaders()</code>,{" "}
            <code>express-rate-limit</code> becomes <code>rateLimit()</code>,{" "}
            <code>csurf</code> becomes <code>csrf()</code>,{" "}
            <code>cookie-parser</code> becomes <code>readRequestCookie()</code> /{" "}
            <code>serializeCookie()</code>, and <code>express.Router()</code>{" "}
            becomes either <code>app.group()</code> or a proper encapsulated
            plugin. The migration guide has the full mapping table for all of
            them, so you are not guessing which DaloyJS thing replaces which
            Express package.
          </p>
          <p>
            And you do not have to do it in one heroic weekend. The guide
            documents a strangler-fig approach: stand DaloyJS up next to your
            existing Express app, put a reverse proxy in front, and move one
            resource at a time (<code>/books</code> first, then the next),
            pointing the proxy at the new routes as they land and deleting the old
            ones. Both apps can share the same database, the same session store,
            and the same JWT secrets during the transition, so logins keep working
            no matter which app serves a given request. You lock each move with
            contract tests using the in-process <code>app.request()</code> client
            (no port, no second terminal), and you repeat until Express is empty
            and you can delete it. That is how you migrate a real production app
            without a scary big-bang cut-over.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want the persuasion version rather than the how-to version,
            there is also a companion post,{" "}
            <Link href="/blog/best-node-express-alternative-daloyjs">
              Why DaloyJS is the best Node.js Express alternative
            </Link>
            , that makes the case in more detail. But honestly, the migration
            guide is the better read, because it shows you the actual code instead
            of just telling you it is nicer.
          </p>

          <h2>Starting a project</h2>
          <CodeBlock language="bash" code={SCAFFOLD} />
          <p>
            You get a working project with the secure middleware stack already
            wired, <code>docs: true</code> on, a runtime template of your choice,
            and containers that ship with a non-root user, <code>tini</code> as
            PID 1, a <code>HEALTHCHECK</code>, and{" "}
            <code>STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM</code>. The <code>--with-ci</code> bundle even
            signs your pushed images with Sigstore Cosign and attaches an SBOM
            attestation, so your consumers can verify the image instead of
            trusting the registry. You did not have to remember any of that. That
            is the recurring theme, in case I have been too subtle: you did not
            have to remember.
          </p>

          <h2>Why I think this is the right bet for 2027</h2>
          <p>
            I am not going to pretend DaloyJS is magic. It is in public preview,
            it is a <code>0.x</code>, and the API can still move between minor
            versions. It will not write your business logic and it will not stop
            you from shipping a bug. No framework can save a determined developer
            from themselves, and I say that as a determined developer who has
            needed saving.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here is the argument. The way we build software changed. The
            volume of code went up, the amount of code any human actually reads
            went down, and the registry turned into a hunting ground. In that
            world, the framework cannot be a neutral tool that does whatever you
            ask. It has to have opinions, it has to default to safe, and it has to
            refuse to do the obviously dangerous thing even when you (or your AI)
            confidently ask for it. The security has to be the thing you would
            have to remove on purpose, not the thing you would have to add on
            purpose. Because the one thing we have learned about vibe-coded apps
            is that nobody adds the boring stuff. They just ship.
          </p>
          <p>
            DaloyJS makes the boring stuff the default and the dangerous stuff the
            exception, and it does that without making you miserable. One route
            definition, full types, live docs, a typed client, a hardened runtime,
            and a supply chain that assumes the worst. If you are starting a new
            TypeScript API in 2027, that is the trade I would take every single
            time.
          </p>

            Go read the <Link href="/docs/security">security docs</Link>, run{" "}
            <code>pnpm create daloy@latest</code>, and try to make it boot with a
            wildcard-credentials CORS config. It will tell you no. That
            &quot;no&quot; is the whole product.
