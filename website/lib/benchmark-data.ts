  "Apples vs oranges, not apples to apples. These are different tools doing different amounts of work. On every request, DaloyJS validates the body against your Zod or Valibot schema and runs secure headers, a request ID, body-size limits, and request timeouts, all out of the box. The 'minimal' apps for the other frameworks do almost none of this, and even 'secure parity' rarely matches it one for one. So part of every DaloyJS number is security and validation you would otherwise have to build yourself.",
  "Footprint methodology differs: DaloyJS is one zero-dependency package, while the others resolve transitive trees whose exact size depends on when the lockfile was generated.",
  "Throughput is workload-shaped: with a comparable middleware stack on both sides, DaloyJS and Hono land within a couple of percent of each other. Real services are usually bound by database and I/O time, not framework dispatch, so these micro-numbers rarely predict production.",
  "Different target runtimes: some frameworks (e.g. Elysia) are tuned for Bun but are measured here under their Node adapters for a fair single-runtime baseline.",
