/**
 * Regression tests for the Qinglong-class authentication-bypass pattern
 * disclosed as CVE-2026-3965 / CVE-2026-4047
 * (https://snyk.io/blog/qinglong-task-scheduler-rce-vulnerabilities/).
 *
 * Both Qinglong CVEs share the same root cause: a mismatch between the
 * security middleware's idea of "what path this request is on" and the
 * framework's actual routing logic. In Qinglong:
 *
 *   - CVE-2026-3965: a `/open/*` → `/api/*` URL rewrite let unauthenticated
 *     requests reach an admin handler whose auth middleware was scoped to
 *     `/api/*`.
 *   - CVE-2026-4047: the auth middleware compared the path case-sensitively
 *     to `/api/`, but Express matched the route case-insensitively, so
 *     `/aPi/...` reached the admin handler with auth skipped.
 *
 * Daloy's design choices that prevent the bug:
 *
 *   - The router is exact, case-sensitive, and rejects `..` / `//` and other
 *     traversal patterns before walking the trie.
 *   - There is no implicit URL rewrite layer — handlers are reached via the
 *     same `url.pathname` the application code sees.
 *   - The `except()` matcher uses the same `url.pathname` view as the
 *     router and is also case-sensitive, so a case-mutated or
 *     trailing-slash-mutated request that the router would have routed to a
 *     protected handler does NOT match an exempt pattern; auth still runs.
 *     The matcher fails CLOSED.
 *
 * These tests lock those properties in so a future refactor of either the
 * router or `except()` cannot reintroduce the Qinglong class of bug.
