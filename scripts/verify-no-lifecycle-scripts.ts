/**
 * Aikido Package Health "Supply-Chain Scripts" governance gate.
 *
 * Aikido's Package Health Score
 * (https://www.aikido.dev/blog/introducing-aikido-package-health) weighs five
 * categories; one of them — **Supply-Chain Scripts** — penalises any
 * install-time lifecycle script declared by a published package, because
 * lifecycle hooks are the primary execution channel for npm worm campaigns
 * (chalk/debug, node-ipc, Shai-Hulud, etc.).
 *
 * Daloy's published packages (`@daloyjs/core`, `create-daloy`) must therefore
 * declare **zero** install-time lifecycle hooks. This script enforces that
 * posture at PR review time so a future contributor cannot quietly add a
 * `postinstall` without a `SECURITY.md` review note.
 *
 * Forbidden hooks (npm runs these on `pnpm install` for the consumer):
 *   - preinstall
 *   - install
 *   - postinstall
 *   - prepare           (runs on `git+` installs and locally on `pnpm install`)
 *   - preprepare
 *   - postprepare
 *   - prepublish        (deprecated alias of `prepare` for older clients)
 *
 * Permitted hooks (maintainer-side only, never run by consumers of the
 * published tarball):
 *   - prepublishOnly    (runs only when *we* publish; the consumer's
 *                        install never invokes it)
 *   - any script under arbitrary names (`build`, `test`, `verify:*`, …) —
 *                        these are only run by humans / CI explicitly
 *
 * Exit code:
 *   0 — every checked package.json is clean.
 *   1 — at least one forbidden hook was found; offending entries are
 *       printed to stderr.
 *
 * @since 0.33.0
