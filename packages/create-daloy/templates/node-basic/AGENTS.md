# AGENTS.md

A [DaloyJS](https://daloyjs.dev) Node.js REST API. **Contract-first**:
routes are defined with Zod schemas and OpenAPI 3.1 is generated from them.

- Package manager: pnpm (use `pnpm` unless the project's `package.json` was rewritten for npm/yarn/bun).
- Runtime: Node.js >= 24.15 (active LTS).

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — watch-mode dev server on http://localhost:3000
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm test` — Node built-in test runner
- `pnpm gen` — regenerate `generated/openapi.json` and the typed Hey API client
- `pnpm build` — emit `dist/`
- `pnpm audit` — supply-chain audit (respects the hardened `.npmrc`)

## Project shape

- `src/build-app.ts` — `buildApp()` factory. Routes, schemas, and middleware live here. **Pure, no side effects.**
- `src/index.ts` — calls `buildApp()` and starts the listener via `@daloyjs/core/node`. The only file that opens a port.
- `scripts/dump-openapi.ts` — imports `buildApp()` and writes `generated/openapi.json`. Codegen reads from `buildApp()` only — never import `src/index.ts` from scripts.
- `generated/` — machine-written by `pnpm gen`. Do not edit by hand.
- `tests/` — `*.test.ts` files run with `node --test` (via `tsx`).

## Core rules

1. The route definition is the contract. Method, path, request schemas, and response schemas live in one place — `app.route({...})`.
2. Validate every input with Zod. Use `.strict()` on top-level object schemas to reject unknown keys at the boundary.
3. Preserve literal types in responses: `status: 200 as const`, `z.literal(...)` on discriminator fields. Codegen depends on these.
4. Throw typed errors (`NotFoundError`, `BadRequestError`, etc.) from `@daloyjs/core` — never return raw error responses.
5. Keep `requestId()`, `secureHeaders()`, and `rateLimit()` enabled. They are the project's secure defaults.
6. Every new route ships with a test that covers a happy path and at least one unhappy path.
7. After any route change: `pnpm gen && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`.

## Process expectations

- Quality gates must pass before declaring work done: `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test`.
- Update the OpenAPI spec and typed client whenever route shapes change (`pnpm gen`).
- Bug fixes include a regression test.
- Never bypass safety checks (`--no-verify`, `--ignore-scripts=false`) without a clear reason.
